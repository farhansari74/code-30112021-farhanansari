Sample Project for Data Science

Basic:

Please note the following for the project files:
1. mainProjectRunning.ipynb : This project uses the data shared and processes the output as expected.
Target data merges the source data and reference data for comparatie analysis and summary.

Below are the source data files read:
1. DataFile.txt : Source Data
2. LookupTable.csv : Reference Data

Below are the source data files generated:
1. DataSource.csv : Source Data in csv format
2. DataSource.json : Source Data in json format

Below are the target data files generated:
1. DataAdditional.csv : Target Data in csv format
2. DataAdditional.json : Target Data in json format

Performance:

Please note the following for the project files are for performance testing using 1,00,000 records.:
1. mainProjectBigSample.ipynb : This project generates the random data within range. It processes the output as expected.
Observation for this case is, the performance does not take much time < 5 secs for 1L records. So the code is best tuned.
Target data merges the source data and reference data for comparatie analysis and summary.
Also it generates the basic graph for easy comparison and reference. 

Below are the source data files read:
1. LookupTable.csv : Reference Data

Below are the source data files generated:
1. BigSampleDataSource.csv : Generated Source Data in csv format
2. BigSampleDataSource.json : Generated Source Data in json format

Below are the target data files generated:
1. BigSampleDataAdditional.csv : Target Data in csv format
2. BigSampleDataAdditional.json : Target Data in json format
